# TestRail Scripts

This set of scripts helps to update test suite and upload test results from Junit format to Testrail.

Install all requirements using:

```
$ pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

We suggest to create a python virtual environment for this.

Export the following variables in the shell where you intend to run the script:

- TESTRAIL\_USER
- TESTRAIL\_TOKEN


# Update test suite

To upload test results to the TestRail necessary to update Test suite of the TestRail and only then upload test results.
Update test suite means to align tests in your Zephyr project with tests in the TestRail, if necessary new test cases and new folders will be added using that script.

1. To receive all test cases from your Zephyr project run sanitycheck command:

```
$ sanitycheck --export-tests testcases.csv
```
After this all test cases will be saved to the file. That file will be used by the script to check if necessary to add new test cases from your project to the TestRail.

2. Then run script to update a Test suite.

```
$ python3 update_testsuite.py -f /home/maksim/Documents/testcases.csv -p 5 -s 58
```

The script supports the following arguments:

```
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PROJECT, --project PROJECT
                        Project ID
  -s SUITE, --suite SUITE
                        Suite ID

Result files (input):
  It is a .csv file with saved test cases generated by the Sanitycheck.

  -f RESULTS_FILE, --results-file RESULTS_FILE
                        File with test results format.
```

After script finished updating test suite, you are ready to upload your test results using TestRail script below.

# Upload test results

The script supports the following arguments:

```
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --runner {tcf,sanitycheck,maxwell,autopts}
                        Select runner to import from.
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        Configuration name.
  -V COMMIT, --commit COMMIT
                        Version being tested (git desribe string)
  -p PROJECT, --project PROJECT
                        Project ID
  -s SUITE, --suite SUITE
                        Suite ID
  -n, --dry-run         Dry run
  -m MILESTONE, --milestone MILESTONE
                        Milestone ID
  -P PLAN, --plan PLAN  Test plan ID

  -b buginfo_file, --buginfo-file buginfo_file for sanitycheck & sanitycheckbatch runner
                     points to a file containing bug info for the error/failure cases.
                     When test cases results will be uploaded into the Test Rail, the bug IDs will be auto added for the error/failure cases.
                     The file format is following:

                     [platform1 name]
                      Case1 name= bug ID
                      Case2 name= bug ID
                     [platform2 name]
                      Case1 name= bug ID

Result files (input):
  You can either select a directory with multiple files or just point to one
  file depending on the source of the results. TCF results expect a
  directory with multiple files, where sanitycheck expect 1 file per
  configuration.

  -j RESULTS_DIR, --results-dir RESULTS_DIR
                        Directory with test result files
  -f RESULTS_FILE, --results-file RESULTS_FILE
                        File with test results format.
```


To upload all Junit results from a directory produced by Sanitycheck, use the following command:

```
$ python3 report.py --runner sanitycheckbatch -j <junit dir> -V <commit_id>    -p <project id> -s <test suite> -m <milestone> -P <plan number optionally>
```

Python script for Sanitycheck and for SanitycheckBatch has useful log information, for better view of it you can follow next step.
For example, if you want to upload all Junit results from a directory, and upload bug information from a file, then see log output, you can use next command. Create empty file log.txt before run that command.

```
$ python3 report.py --runner sanitycheckbatch -j junit4TestRail -V master-2019-10-16-3d4aef8f99    -p 5 -s 52 -m 9 -b buginfo.ini>> log.txt
```

To upload one single Junit file produced by Sanitycheck, use the following command:

```
$ python3 report.py --runner sanitycheck -f <junit file> -V v1.13.0-1386-g183e7445c6.2379 -p <project id> -s <test suite> -m <milestone> -c <config name> -P <plan number optionally>
```
If you will use -P plan number (Plan ID), you can upload new results to the already created page of the Test Run in the TestRail system.
To know plan number just open page with already created Test Run and check webpage address, for example you will have 'zephyrproject.testrail.io/index.php?/plans/view/0101'
Number 0101 it is you plan number and you can use it to upload result to that Test Run. Also you can find Plan ID in the log output.
